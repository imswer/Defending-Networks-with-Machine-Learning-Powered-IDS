Defending Networks with Machine Learning-Powered IDS
With the rapid advancement in technology and widespread digitization, network data traffic has surged significantly. This has simultaneously led to an increase in vulnerabilities and threats to computer systems and data, as network attacks become more frequent and sophisticated. As internet usage grows, so does the need for robust network security solutions. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as an effective approach to identify and prevent unauthorized access, safeguarding networks from potential intruders.

In this project, we utilize the KDD dataset to develop a machine learning-based IDS capable of detecting malicious activities and distinguishing them from normal connections. Our approach integrates preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using an ensemble of classifiers—Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.

Project Objectives
The objective is to classify network traffic into normal or malicious categories using a well-structured methodology that enhances detection accuracy and reduces false positives.

Methodology
The project implementation is divided into four key phases:

Dataset Loading and Preprocessing:
The raw dataset is loaded and cleaned to remove irrelevant or redundant data. Symbolic features are converted to numeric values, and continuous and discrete features are standardized to improve compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is performed to visualize the dataset, understand feature distributions, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. Insights derived from EDA are instrumental in guiding feature selection and model training.

Model Training and Testing:
Three classifiers—Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and XGBoost—are trained on the preprocessed dataset. Each algorithm offers unique strengths, contributing to the robustness of the final model.

Ensemble Classification for Predictions:
Ensemble learning techniques, such as majority voting, are employed to combine the predictions from the three classifiers. This method leverages the strengths of individual models to improve overall accuracy and reliability.

Steps Involved
1. Preprocessing:
Integration and Cleaning:
The dataset contains features of various forms (continuous, discrete, symbolic) with varying scales and resolutions. Preprocessing involves integrating data, handling missing values, and removing outliers.
Feature Transformation:
Symbolic features are converted into numeric formats, and class labels are standardized for better interpretability. Irrelevant and redundant features are removed to reduce noise.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Using statistical visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps, EDA identifies key characteristics of the dataset, such as feature relationships, anomalies, and class distributions. This helps refine the preprocessing pipeline and model-building strategies.

3. Building Classifiers:
Decision Tree:
Decision trees classify data by splitting it based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. Their simplicity and effectiveness make them ideal for intrusion detection tasks.

Gaussian Naive Bayes:
This variant of Naive Bayes assumes a Gaussian distribution for continuous features, enabling it to efficiently classify data even with limited training samples.

XGBoost:
XGBoost is a gradient-boosting framework that builds sequential decision trees. It excels in handling imbalanced datasets and improves classification accuracy by minimizing both bias and variance.

4. Ensemble Learning:
An ensemble approach aggregates predictions from multiple classifiers using majority voting. Each classifier votes for a class label, and the final prediction corresponds to the majority vote. This approach enhances model robustness and reduces overfitting.

Benefits of the Proposed IDS
Enhanced Accuracy:
Combining classifiers through ensemble techniques improves prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of individual algorithms.

Scalability:
The proposed model can adapt to large-scale datasets due to efficient preprocessing and robust classifiers like XGBoost.

Reduced False Positives:
Ensemble learning helps mitigate the limitations of individual models, leading to more reliable detection.

Versatility:
The system can handle diverse data types and scales, making it suitable for various network environments.
